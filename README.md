# Number-Guessing-Game
The Number Guessing Game is a simple yet engaging JavaScript-based mini-project where players must guess a randomly generated number within a given range. The game provides 10 attempts to correctly identify the number. After each guess, the game gives feedback, indicating whether the guessed number is too high or too low, helping the player refine their choices.
